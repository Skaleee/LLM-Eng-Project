      "Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM, there is much inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand, and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives.<br /><br />But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /><br />This movie is unrelentingly grim--\"noir\" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. Grim, but intriguing, and frightening. Is the prior text positive or negative? Give us a rating out of 10.\n",
      "The prior text is a mixed review of the film Zentropa. The reviewer acknowledges similarities with The Third Man, praises the inventive camera work, and notes the intriguing and frightening nature of the film. However, they also mention that Zentropa's storyline is more disjointed compared to The Third Man, suggesting that it might be intentional due to the dream/nightmare presentation. The overall tone is not entirely positive, but it does highlight several strengths of the film.\n",
